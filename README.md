In part of the coding process, I used Chatgpt to help me with my css portions. I havent been good with my designing in the past and I used it as a tool to fine tune designs that I was struggling to get just right, learn new css tools, and make a cohesive design that made it more user friendly. I used it to learn action tools, such as implementing click and hover actions.
